## 👋 Hi, I'm Ahmed

I'm a frontend developer who crafts web experiences with intention, clarity, and purpose.  
Specializing in **React**, **Next.js**, and **Webflow**, I build fast, responsive, and visually refined user interfaces that focus on real user impact.

I love turning ideas into smooth, modern, and meaningful digital experiences — blending clean code, thoughtful design, and seamless interactions.
